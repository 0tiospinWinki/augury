## I'm new. Anything I should know?
[newcomer]: #newcomer

:wave:Hello and welcome. The answer to that question is yes, a lot. To
help, here are few resources we thought you might find useful.

### The manual
[readme]: #readme

The first thing you should do is _read_ the [README](./README.md).
We've put a lot of love and care in writing it and it should provide
you with the context you need for contributing to this project. Really,
you should read it...especially [the section where we list everything
that we know is wrong right now](./README.md#known-issues) or [that
part where we talk about our hopes and dreams for the future of the
project](./README.md#future-plans).

### The textbook
[developer-readme]: #developer-readme

If you want to get technical, we've got you covered too. We have [a
README just for developers](./DEVELOPER.md). Jumping into a new codebase
can be daunting so we've tried, as best as we could, to give you an
overview into the design of Batarangle and our intentions. It's a
glimpse into our heads, if you will. We're not yet sure that's a good
thing but we can assure you it's a useful one.

### The chat room
[slack]: #slack

Okay, [manuals](./README.md) and [textbooks](./DEVELOPER.md) are great
and all but they make for poor conversation. Feel free to [join us on
Slack](http://batarangle-slack.herokuapp.com/)! Whether you're looking
for answers or just want to hang out and share funny pictures, there's a
channel for that. You can also ask us questions in private. We can't
wait to hear from you.

> Remember: No contribution is too small and no issue is too trivial. If
> you see a typo, we'd love to get a PR. We actually hate
> typos...they're the worst.


### Pull Requests

The core team will be monitoring for pull requests.

*Before* submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is doneâ€¦

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, development workflow or aspects of the architecrure, update the corresponding documentation.
4. TypeScript linter is part of our build task, make sure your code lints before submitting your PRs.

## Bugs

### Where to Find Known Issues

We are using GitHub Issues for our public bugs. We will keep track on this and will to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesn't already exist. 

We are using [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io/) to manage our sprints and milestones. Add it to your GitHub account to see what is in the current sprint/milestone.

### Reporting New Issues

The best way to get a bug fixed is to provide a test case with either one of the example apps bundled in the repo, or by making your own Angular 2.0 application illustrating the reduced use case.

## How to Get in Touch

We are using a Slack for all of our communication. If you want to contribute or need help getting started, join us on Slack by filling in [this form](https://rangle.typeform.com/to/SQsWag).

## Coding Style

* Use semicolons;
* Commas last,
* 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
* Prefer `'` over `"`
* 80 character line length
* ...

More information can be found in `tslint.json` file of this repository.
TypeScript linter is part of our build task and will run in either `npm run build` or `npm start`
